To Do:
	-Translations
	-Make icon scale better.
	-Should we track the speaker object ID as well, and have an alternate comparison options?
		-Gut feeling is no, more complexity that's unnecessary unless we run into an actual bug.
	-See if we can make up names for unnamed NPCs, like "Lalafell 1", etc.
		-When would we reset the numbering?
		-What about mamool-ja and other non-playable races?  How are they even noted?
		-Will probably want to start tracking the speakers ENpc ID if we do this.

Notes:
	-Testing of duplicate chat entry filtering can be accomplished easily in Haukke (Hard) with the first few NPCs up the stairs and down the hall.
		-They talk in both speech bubbles, and in the NPC Dialogue (Announcements) chat channel.
